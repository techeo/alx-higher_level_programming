0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

This project explores object-relational mapping using Python with MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy for database interaction. It includes scripts to perform various tasks such as listing states, filtering states by name, handling user input safely, listing cities, and manipulating data using SQLAlchemy.

The tasks include fetching states, filtering states by specific criteria, updating states, deleting states, and establishing relationships between states and cities. The scripts interact with MySQL databases and are executed with command-line arguments for authentication and database selection.

Overall, the project offers a practical exploration of database manipulation techniques in Python, emphasizing security and efficiency through SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities.
